# Group Project: Interactive Web Application using a 3rd Party API

## Challenge

This is your first group project and an opportunity to use the skills you've learned over the last five weeks.  
In this project, you will work in teams of three to wireframe, design, plan, and develop an interactive Web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that utilises one or more 3rd Party APIs.

Your application must:

- Accept and validate user input
- Query and use data from one or more 3rd Party APIs
- Display data-driven results to the user
- Be responsive across devices
- Be deployed on GitHub Pages

### API Ideas

Here are 10 public APIs that use no or simple authentication, along with potential app ideas:

1. **REST Countries API** — [https://restcountries.com](https://restcountries.com)  
   Build a “World Explorer” app where users search for a country and see key details and its flag.

2. **OpenWeatherMap API** — [https://openweathermap.org/api](https://openweathermap.org/api)  
   Create a “Today’s Forecast” dashboard showing temperature, conditions, and icons for different cities.

3. **Rick and Morty API** — [https://rickandmortyapi.com](https://rickandmortyapi.com)  
   Build a “Character Gallery” with filters for species, status, or episode.

4. **NewsAPI** — [https://newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org)  
   Create a “Tech News Feed” that shows the latest articles from your chosen category.

5. **Dog CEO’s Dog API** — [https://dog.ceo/dog-api/](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/)  
   Build a “Random Dog Generator” or “Guess the Breed” quiz.

6. **TheMealDB API** — [https://www.themealdb.com/api.php](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php)  
   Create a “What’s for Dinner?” app that generates random recipes or lets users search by ingredient.

7. **Cat Facts API** — [https://catfact.ninja](https://catfact.ninja)  
   Build a “Daily Cat Fact” app that delivers a new fact each day.

8. **OMDb API (Open Movie Database)** — [https://www.omdbapi.com](https://www.omdbapi.com)  
   Make a “Movie Search” app that displays results and allows users to save favourites.

9. **PokéAPI** — [https://pokeapi.co](https://pokeapi.co)  
   Build a “Pokédex” that displays random Pokémon with their stats and abilities.

10. **JSONPlaceholder** — [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com)  
    Build a “Mini Blog” that fetches posts and allows users to create, edit, and delete them (mock CRUD).

## Key Learnings

Through this exercise, you will practice:

- Working with APIs
- DOM manipulation
- Asynchronous JavaScript (fetch, promises, async/await)
- Collaboration and project planning in a group environment
- Responsive design and deployment using GitHub Pages

---

## User Story

As a user, I want to interact with a web application that uses real-world data from a 3rd Party API so that I can explore information, view live updates, or generate results based on my input.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The team works collaboratively, using GitHub for version control and branching.
- [ ] The app has a wireframe and README describing the purpose, features, and chosen API(s).
- [ ] The web app accepts and validates user input (e.g., search query, form data, button click).
- [ ] The app makes API calls using `fetch()` or `async/await`.
- [ ] The app handles errors and edge cases gracefully (e.g., invalid input, empty results).
- [ ] The app displays data dynamically using JavaScript and DOM manipulation.
- [ ] The interface is responsive and works on desktop and mobile devices.
- [ ] The final project is deployed on GitHub Pages.
- [ ] The team presents the project, explaining their API choice, data flow, and technical challenges.

## Tips for Success

- Use Trello, Notion, or a GitHub Project Board to organize tasks.
- Assign clear roles (e.g., API developer, UI designer, QA tester).
- Use console.log() frequently to debug API responses.
- Start small — get the API working first, then add styling and features.
- Test responsiveness using Chrome DevTools.

---

## Stretch Goals

- Use multiple APIs to combine different data sources.
- Add local storage to save user preferences or favorites.
- Implement search filters or pagination.
- Include animations or transitions for polished interactivity.
- Add a loading state or error message for better UX.

Good luck — this is your first step toward building a fully functional web app as a team!
